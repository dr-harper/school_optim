**WARNING: what I about to present is not the "tool" itself. These are designed to support decision making**

- Based on this discussion we can look at how the final tool could be delivered.
- Interactive maps used to facilitate discussion about the data layers available

# State Level Indicators

At a state level, what the are key indicators that you need to know?

- Coverage statistics?
- Number of schools needed?

# School Data

```{r loadData}
